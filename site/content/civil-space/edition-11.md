The mentorship program that took place on the
12th of June 2019, the Level 5 (MEng5) civ-
il engineering students to mentor the Level
3(MEng3) civil engineering students was a successful
and fashionable l occasion. This initiative was brought
about the Civil Engineering club under the leadership
of KACDEU WELAPINOU Baudoin. It provides an
opportunity to create a more stable network between
the engineers of the NASPW within and out of school.
This network will enable more and more challenges to
be overcome while serving as a great boost for the civil
engineers in their professional lives while acting as a
team (together everyone achieves more).
The occasion also embodied the handing out of priz-
es and awards for the Mini tournament organized by
the Civil Engineering club. Prizes and grants included
deductions for the software training programs orga-
nized by the Civil Engineering Club in any winner
intended to learn.
